      <h3>PROFILE</h3>
      <p>I am an enthusiastic self-starter with a proven ability to learn, problem-solve and adapt to challenging situations.
        Having gained a wealth of experience and skills as a paramedic, I am embarking on a new chapter and learning to become a developer.
        I'm at the start of my journey with pursuing a career in development and looking for training within the industry.
        With a grounding knowledge in HTML, CSS and Javascript, I have built various small programs and websites but aspire to eventually create innovative solutions to complex issues.
        I'd like to shift my patient-focused nature to a user-focused nature and develop solutions that work well for users.
        One aspect I am passionate about that pairs well with my growing development knowledge is the importance of usability and accessibility.
        I am looking forward to expanding my skills by learning new languages, contributing to open source projects and getting involved with the industry.
