      <h3>PROFILE</h3>
      <p>Hello! I'm James, a junior web developer with a keen interest in furthering my knowledge in software engineering. Over the last few months I have begun my adventure
        in the world of programming and have enjoyed every minute of it. So far I have made good headway on a course titled "The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp" by Dr Angela Yu
        on Udemy. While my course so far has mainly covered front-end web development, I am a fast learner and capable of adapting to new challenges.

      <h3>EXPERIENCE</h3>
      <div class="box_2_sub_headers">
        <h4>Paramedic - South East Coast Ambulance Service</h4>
        <p class="subtitle-attach-right">2018-Present</p>
      </div>
      <p>My professional career so far has been working as a Paramedic with South East Coast Ambulance Service, working frontline on ambulances tasked with responding to 999 calls. From this I will be able to bring
        numerous transferable skills such as being able to work well under pressure, as well as being able to work as part of multi-disciplinary teams. As I am classed as an experienced Paramedic, my responsibilities also included working shifts on the Solo Response Vehicle, and as such I am also capable of working
        independently, visualising aims and working to find ways to problem solve and make sure the objectives are met.
